		<h2>Early Reign</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 25px;">Akhenaten, also spelled Akhenaton, Akhnaton, or Ikhnaton, also called Amenhotep IV, Greek Amenophis, king (1353–36 BCE) of ancient Egypt of the 18th dynasty, who established a new cult dedicated to the Aton, the sun’s disk (hence his assumed name, Akhenaten, meaning “beneficial to Aton”).

		<p style="font-size: 25px;">That same year Akhenaten moved his capital to a new site some 200 miles (300 km) north of Thebes. The location chosen for the new capital, named Akhetaton (“Horizon of the Aton”; Tell el-Amarna), was a virgin site on the east bank of the Nile River, a large desert embayment enclosed by limestone cliffs, in which a series of boundary stelae were carved. The boundary texts, dated the fifth, sixth, and eighth years of his rule, describe the planned city in some detail and reveal Akhenaten’s primary intention: to construct a city dedicated to the worship of the Aton separate from already established cults.

		<h2>Last events of the reign</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 25px;">Toward the end of his reign, Akhenaten is shown on certain monuments together with another king, whose coronation name was Ankhkheperure and whose personal name was Neferneferuaten, the initial element of Nefertiti’s own name. Whether this personage is in fact a new male coregent whose origin cannot now be traced or whether it is Nefertiti herself elevated to the status of male pharaoh remains a controversial issue. This king’s personal name, Neferneferuaton, was then changed to Smenkhkare, the name by which he is more widely known. Akhenaten seems to have ruled with Smenkhkare until Akhenaten’s death in his 17th regnal year, when he was presumably buried in the royal tomb at Akhetaton; Smenkhkare then seems to have had an independent rule of perhaps three years, although Smenkhkare’s biographical and regnal details remain unclear. The city that Akhenaten founded did not long survive; jar dockets from Akhetaton indicate that the site was abandoned by the third regnal year of his son and successor, Tutankhamun
