			Cleopatra VII ruled ancient Egypt as co-regent (first with her father,<br> then with her two younger brothers and finally with her son) for almost three decades.<br><br> She was part of a dynasty of Macedonian rulers founded by Ptolemy, who served as general under Alexander the Great during his conquest of Egypt in 332 B.C.<br><br> Well-educated and clever, Cleopatra could speak various languages and served as the dominant ruler in all three of her co-regencies. Her romantic liaisons and military alliances with the Roman leaders Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, as well as her supposed exotic beauty and powers of seduction, earned her an enduring place in history and popular myth.</p>

			 Cleopatra VII known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. She originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes, and later with her brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler. As queen, she consummated a liaison with Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated Caesarion, her son with Caesar, to co-ruler in name.<br><br>

			 After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later known as Augustus). <br><br> With Antony, she bore the twins Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios, and son Ptolemy Philadelphus.<br><br> Antony committed suicide after losing the Battle of Actium to Octavian's forces, and Cleopatra followed suit. <br> According to a popular belief, she killed herself by means of an asp bite on August 12, 30 BC.
