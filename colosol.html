		The institution of kingship in Egypt dates from around 3100 BC, when the ‘two lands’ of Upper and Lower Egypt – the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta – were first united under a single ruler. This act of unification was seen as establishing divine order, personified as a goddess, Maat. It was the king’s responsibility to maintain this perfect balance, making sure that the sun continued to rise and set each day, and that the Nile would flood each year to provide the fertile land needed to grow food. It was up to him to ensure that order and justice prevailed in society, and that Egypt was properly governed and protected from its enemies.<br><br>

		As a sign of this duty, every new king was crowned separately with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Crown of Upper Egypt before receiving the Double Crown of the Two Lands and the titles The Dual King and Lord of the Two Lands. This crown is now missing from the statue, but the base, with its circlet of protecting cobras, can be seen above Ramesses’ royal headcloth.<br><br>

		Kings were often shown holding a crook and flail, symbols of animal herding and agriculture – a crook was used by a shepherd, a flail to separate grain from its husks. These also were the attributes of the god Osiris, Egypt’s first king, and showed the pharaoh’s dominion over the country and its people.<br><br>

		The king could only fulfil his role with the help of the gods, and to win their support he built temples all over Egypt, enriching them with costly statues and lavish offerings. Temple buildings were always symmetrical to enshrine divine order; even the hieroglyphs used in the inscriptions on their walls could be written left to right or right to left to preserve the sacred balance.<br>
