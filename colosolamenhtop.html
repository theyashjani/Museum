	<p style="font-size: 140%;">This enormous red granite statue of Amenhotep III depicts the Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt.<br>

		This massive large fragment was created in 1370 BC,  was found in the temple enclosure of Mut at Karnak in Egypt. The statue is made of red granite, and only the head and an arm are known to survive.<br>

		Erected by King Amenhotep III, it is one of the many statues that he had ordered to be built in ancient Thebes (Luxor). The left arm is 3.30m long and terminates in a clenched fist, and the head is 2.90m high.<br>

		The kingâ€™s statue would have stood with both arms straight down, holding containers for papyrus documents in his hand.<br>

		After its discovery, the statue in 1817 it was ascribed initially as a statue to another Pharaoh by mistake. The confusion arose from the modification of the head by later Pharaohs, a practice that was common in Ancient Egypt.<br><br>

		<strong>Colossal granite head of King Amenhotep III, from Karnak (Thebes), Egypt, about 1370 BC.</strong><br>
		King Amenhotep III commissioned numerous statues of himself, especially for his temples in Thebes, then Egypt's capital. His peaceful reign was a time of opulence and outstanding artistic refinement, often displayed on a grand and ambitious scale. The complete sculpture showed him striding. This and a slightly smaller colossus flanked a doorway in the temple of Mut in Karnak. The head of the second statue is also in the British Museum, but the bodies remain in Karnak. A century later the facial features were reworked for King Ramesses II to match his own official 'portrait'. Ramesses appropriated countless statues of royal predecessors.
