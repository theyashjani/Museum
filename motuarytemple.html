	<p style="font-size: 140%;">
		Mortuary temple, in ancient Egypt, place of worship of a deceased king and the depository for food and objects offered to the dead monarch.<br><br> In the Old and Middle Kingdoms (c. 2575–c. 2130 BCE; and 1938–c. 1630 BCE) the mortuary temple usually adjoined the pyramid and had an open, pillared court, storerooms, five elongated shrines, and a chapel containing a false door and an offering table. In the chapel, priests performed the daily funerary rites and presented the offerings to the dead king’s ka (protective spirit).<br><br> In the New Kingdom (1539–1075 BCE) the kings were buried in rock-cut tombs, but separate mortuary temples continued to be built nearby.<br><br> All were provided with a staff of priests and assured of supplies through endowments of estates and lands, to ensure religious services and offerings in perpetuity.<br><br>

		The first mortuary temple was built for Amenhotep I of the 18th Dynasty during the New Kingdom. Several other rulers of this dynasty built temples for the same purpose, the best known being those at Deir el-Bahari, where Hatshepsut built beside the funerary temple of Mentuhotep II, and that of Amenhotep III, of which the only major extant remains are the Colossi of Memnon.<br><br>

		Later rulers of the 18th Dynasty either failed to build here at all or, in the case of Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb, their construction was not completed. The 19th Dynasty ruler Seti I constructed his mortuary temple at what is now known as Gurna.<br><br> Part of his "Glorious temple of Seti Merenptah in the field of Amun which resides at the West of Thebes" was dedicated to his father Ramesses I, whose short reign prevented him from building his own, and was completed by his son Ramesses II.<br><br>

		Ramesses II constructed his own temple, referred to as the Ramesseum (a name given to it by Champollion in 1829): "Temple of a million years of Usermaatre Setepenre which is linked with Thebes-the-Quoted in the Field of Amun, in the West".<br><br>

		Much later, during the 20th Dynasty, Ramesses III constructed his own temple at Medinet Habu.<br><br>
