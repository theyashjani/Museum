			Ramses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. He ruled during the New Kingdom for either 66 years. The early part of his reign was focused on building cities, temples, and monuments. By the time of his death, aged about 90 years, Ramesses was suffering from severe dental problems and was plagued by arthritis and hardening of the arteries. He had made Egypt rich from all the supplies and riches he had collected from other empires. He had outlived many of his wives and children and left great memorials all over Egypt. Nine more pharaohs took the name Ramesses in his honour.
