	<p style="font-size: 140%;">As the parents of Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III, Yuya and Tjuyu were granted burial in the Valley of the Kings. They were provided with funerary equipment from the finest royal workshops, as demonstrated by this superbly carved shabti on which even the knees are subtly indicated. The text on these mummiform figurines states that the shabti will substitute for the spirit in any obligatory tasks it is called upon to perform in the afterlife.

	Two other shabtis from this tomb (30.8.56 and 30.8.58) are also in the Museum's collection.<br><br>
