			Tutankhamun was the son of Akhenaten<br><br>
			 Tutankhamun commonly referred to as King Tut, was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c. 1334 â€“ 1325 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history.<br><br> His father was the mummy found in the tomb KV55, believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten. His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who was found in KV35.<br><br>
			 Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related.<br><br></p>

			 <p style="font-size: 25px;">
			 The 1922 discovery by Howard Carter of Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb, in excavations funded by Lord Carnarvon,received worldwide press coverage. With over 5,000 artifacts, <br><br> it sparked a renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun's mask, now in the Egyptian Museum, remains a popular symbol. <br><br> The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of Tutankhamun's mummy have been popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs. He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as "King Tut".<br><br>

			 Tutankhamun, also called King Tut was nine years old when he became Pharaoh and reigned for approximately ten years. He is the world's best known pharaoh because his tomb is among the best preserved, and his image and associated artifacts the most-exhibited. <br> sIn historical terms, Tutankhamun's significance stems from the fact that his reign was close to the apogee of Egypt as a world power and from his rejection of the radical religious innovations introduced by his predecessor and father, Akhenaten.
